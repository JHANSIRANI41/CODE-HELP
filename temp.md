❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(a,b){return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ Lack of whitespace reduces readability.
* ❌ Missing JSDoc comments

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
/**
* Sums two numbers.
*
* @param {number} a The first number.
* @param {number} b The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ Added JSDoc comments to describe the function, parameters, and return value.
* ✔ Added whitespace to improve readability.
